# Fast Food Sales Data Analysis

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Using a .csv file containing fast food sales  records.
2. **SQL Queries**: Processing and analyzing data using SQL queries to generate meaningful reports.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using Jupyter Notebook to perform statistical analysis, visualizations, and insights extraction.
## Files in the Repository

* **Fast Food Sales.csv**: The dataset containing fast food sales information.
* **fast_food_sales_report.sql**: SQL queries used to analyze and generate insights from the dataset.
* **Sales Report.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook used for EDA and visualization of the sales data.
## Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following columns:

* order_id: Unique identifier for each order.
* date: Date of the sale.
* item_name: Name of the item sold.
* item_type: Category of the item (e.g., Fastfood, Beverages).
* item_price: Price of the item.
* quantity: Number of items sold.
* transaction_amount: Total transaction amount.
* transaction_type: Type of payment (e.g., Cash, Online).
* received_by: Name of the person handling the sale.
* time_of_sale: Time when the sale occurred (e.g., Night, Afternoon).
## Technologies Used

* Python: For EDA and data manipulation.
* MySQL: For writing SQL queries and data retrieval.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
* Jupyter Notebook: For conducting the exploratory data analysis.
## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ReenaLonare1998/Sales_Reporting
```
    

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas

pip install matplotlib

pip install seaborn

pip install notebook
```

3. Opening the Jupyter Notebook
To explore the sales report and the EDA, follow these steps:

Navigate to the project folder where the notebook is located. For example, if the notebook is in the sale_reporting folder:
```bash
cd Sale_Reporting
```
2. Open the terminal and install Jupyter Notebook (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install notebook
```
3. Once Jupyter is installed, launch it using the following command:

```bash
python -m notebook
```
This will open Jupyter in your browser. Navigate to the **Sales Report.ipynb**  file and open it to explore the notebook and perform EDA.
## Conclusion

The project provides a comprehensive analysis of fast food sales, identifying important trends such as peak sales periods and high-performing regions. The analysis helps businesses understand customer behavior and optimize sales strategies.
